  <p>Hello there!</p>
  <p>My name is Hannah Stockschlaeder, and I am a 19 year old sophmore in the graphic design program in Alfred State. This website you are viewing is a quarantine gallery project for a my interactive design class!</p>
  <p>The animals you can see in the photos are my dog, Lily, she's a white lab. The gray cat? Her name is Molly. The black cats name is Bellatrix, Bella for short. My family has a thing for Harry Potter in case you didn't know. </p>
<p> Speaking of my family, I have 3 sisters, and I am the second oldest in the family</p>
<p>Some of the photos you see in my gallery are some of artwork, although I'm going to Alfred State for graphic design, I still paint with traditional mediums pretty well. </p>
